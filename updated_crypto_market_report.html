        <h2>Market Outlook</h2>
        <p>The cryptocurrency market shows signs of consolidation after the significant gains seen in early 2025.

        <p>Key factors to watch in the coming months include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The impact of Trump's tariff policies on global markets and cryptocurrency</li>
            <li>Institutional adoption trends and ETF flows</li>
            <li>Potential inclusion of cryptocurrencies in the U.S. government's strategic reserve</li>
            <li>Federal Reserve monetary policy decisions</li>
            <li>Technological advancements in layer-1 and layer-2 solutions</li>
        </ul>
        <p>While short-term volatility is expected to continue, the fundamental growth of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency adoption suggests a positive long-term outlook for the sector.</p>
